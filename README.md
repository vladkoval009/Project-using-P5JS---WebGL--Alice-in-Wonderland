Project using P5JS & WebGL: Alice in Wonderland

One of my favourite childhood books is Alice in Wonderland. I wanted to share my nostalgic vision through the digital interpretation of my memories. I loved the idea that I could create my own little version of this story and allow the user the chance to BE Alice for a moment.
I wanted the user to experience actually going INTO the world of Alice in Wonderland and therefore used the concept of the objects and experience being physically contained within a planet like sphere. Once inside the sphere then the user has entered wonderland.
Alice in Wonderland is one of the earliest and most famous fantasy novels and has been described as almost psychedelic in it’s subject matter. Alice changes shape and size, takes potions, eats mushrooms and while there is no evidence of the author Lewis Carroll having been under the influence, this was the age of legal opium use and it’s effects permeated the Victorian era’s imagination.
The famous 1960’s band Jefferson Airplane’s psychedelic anthem inspired by the story “White Rabbit” runs with the same themes..
“When the men on the chessboard get up And tell you where to go
And you’ve just had some kind of mushroom And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice, I think she’ll know.”
Using these images, and inspired by the original illustrations from the book – I began deciding upon what elements I wanted in my version of this Wonderland. I wanted to include the manipulation of time (illustrated by the giant pocket watch), the mushrooms, the chess board, a floating cat head and of course it wouldn’t be complete without flying playing cards.
